# Fantastic_Dictionary


A Dictionary Application made using Python Programming Language.


Working:
This application takes the input as a word and gives out meaning of the word as output.The meaaning of the word is fetched from the .json file.

Moreover this application ask the user whether they want to find/search the meaning of some other word again or just want to quit the application.
For this I have used recursive function.

Requirements:
json module   --> This is present from start when python is been intstalled.
Difflib   --> This module is too present when we install python on our system so we dont have too install these two modules externally.
req_data.json  --->You can copy this file from my repository.


This Fantastic_Dictionary Application is sequel of the following Dictionary:

https://github.com/vasu2411/Interactive_Dictionary

You can also find the explaination blog link on this repo(not a promotion,I geniunely read that blog and done some changes to make the application recursive.)




For basic understanding of this Dictionary you visit this link and learn from there too.

This Dictionary application was edited from the above git repo to learn Recursive function by me(@DevAStar08).
